# A Bayesian Dirichlet Multinomial Regression Model for Integrative Analysis of Clinical and Single Cell Data

We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for the integration of cell-type abundance count data and covariates analysis. The aim of this model is to uncover the relationship between covariates and abundance of cell types, and how phenotypes are shaped by the different types of cells.
